      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a summa cum laude Computer Science graduate from Fordham University with a growing software development, data analytics, and cybersecurity portfolio. </p>
      <p>My interests span developing intelligent applications, uncovering insights from large datasets, and protecting digital systems against evolving threats. Accordingly, my experiences through internships and part-time work have involved building secure data pipelines, automating SQL workflows, performing vulnerability scans, conducting penetration tests, and collaborating with technical teams to develop and analyze software systems. </p>
      <p>I’m familiar with a wide range of tools and technologies that support my work across disciplines. In software development, I’ve worked with Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, SQL, and frameworks like React, Node.js, and Tkinter. For data analytics, I frequently use Pandas, NumPy, and MongoDB to process and analyze large datasets. My cybersecurity toolkit includes tools like Splunk, Wireshark, Nessus, Qualys, Burp Suite, and secure practices involving SSL/TLS and AES encryption. </p>
      <p>I’m passionate about solving problems at the intersection of code, data, and digital defense. I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can make meaningful contributions to technical teams and continue to learn and grow in these domains.</p>
